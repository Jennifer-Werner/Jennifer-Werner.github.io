            <p class="SmallParagraph OurMissionParagraph">Our mission is to create an international program that will provide educational opportunities to all interested primary and secondary school students across the world, who were forced to immigrate to a foreign country due to political circumstances. We strive to ensure that the implementation of our project will improve the quality of education, providing equal opportunities for receiving help and education around the globe.</p>

            <p class=" SmallParagraph OurValuesParagraph">Many young people are struggling with adaptation in a new country due to forced political immigration. For political refugees, integrating into a foreign society presents formidable challenges, compounded by linguistic barriers that hinder meaningful connections with locals. According to recent studies, approximately 65 million people worldwide have been displaced due to political conflict, with many facing difficulties in accessing education, employment, and social services in their host countries. Language proficiency remains a significant obstacle, with around 40% of refugees in developed countries lacking basic language skills, impeding their ability to fully engage in community life and achieve socio-economic stability. Hence, we want to craft a program that does not only create educational opportunities for children, but also provides them with support in this difficult process of adapting to a new environment through making connections with their peers.</p>
